BACKGROUND AND AIMS:The aMAP score is a model that predicts risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in patients![](Aspose.Words.3727b471-b81a-4adf-a3e7-1f1cb6917cd3.003.png) with chronic hepatitis. Its performance in a real world  surveillance setting has not yet been ascertained.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:We had access to a cohort of 3473 individuals enrolled in a rigorously implemented and prospectively accrued surveillance programme (patients undergoing regular ultrasound and biomarker examination between 1998 and 2021). During this period 445 had HCC detected. Of these, 77.8% had early stage disease (within Milan criteria), permitting potentially curative therapy to be implemented in nearly 70% of cases. We applied the recently developed aMAP score to classify patients according to their initial aMAP score in to low, medium and high-risk groups as proposed in the original publication. The performance of the aMAP score was assessed according to the concordance-index and calibration (i.e. agreement between

observed and predicted risk). Allowance was made for competing causes of death.

RESULTS:The aMAP score achieved an overall C-index of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79  0.82) consistent with the initial report and was unaffected by allowance for competing causes of death. Sub-group analysis showed that the results did not change signi  cantly according to gender, or aetiology. However, aMAP discrimination was greater for younger individuals (versus older individuals), and also for individuals without cirrhosis. The HCC incidence rate was 0.98, 7.05 and 29.1 events per 1000 person-years in the low-, moderate- and high-risk aMAP groups, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS:The results from this real-world  cohort demonstrate that risk strati  cation is a realistic prospect and that

identi  cation of a subgroup of chronic liver disease patients who have a very low risk of HCC is feasible.

INTRODUCTION

Potentially curative therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rely on early diagnosis [[1\].](#_page19_x0.00_y144.87) To achieve this outcome regular, typically six-monthly, ultrasound (US) examinations of patients with hepatic cirrhosis is recommended, with or without the tumour marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) [[2\].](#_page19_x0.00_y170.87) However, uptake into surveillance programmes has been poor particularly across the western world where only 20  40% of patients developing HCC have been detected within a surveillance programme and early diagnosis remains uncommon [3[\].](#_page19_x0.00_y197.87) The barriers to effective implementation have been clearly identi  ed [[4](#_page19_x0.00_y215.87)] and one of these is that not all clinical or funding agencies have been convinced of the value of surveillance since there has been no acceptable controlled study [ [5](#_page19_x0.00_y242.87)]. Harms have been identi  ed, not least of which has been the anxiety engendered by regular scans, each of which may reveal a potentially lethal cancer and false-positive results [[6](#_page19_x0.00_y260.87)].

In Japan, a government-funded and well-designed surveillance programme which was started in the 1980s, probably represents

the upper limit of what can be expected from current surveillance strategies [[7\].](#_page19_x0.00_y287.87) Median survival of those detected with HCC has increased, decade on decade, from <4 months in the 1980s (as it was then in other countries) to >4 years [7[, ](#_page19_x0.00_y287.87)8[\] ](#_page19_x0.00_y314.87)currently. Since 2000 such advances seem to re  ect improving underlying liver function as well as earlier detection and better treatment [9, [10](#_page19_x0.00_y332.87)[\]. ](#_page19_x0.00_y359.87)The recently developed aMAP score, based on age, gender, platelet count and the ALBI score [[11\],](#_page19_x0.00_y386.87) appears to accurately predict the likelihood of HCC development in populations under surveillance, paving the way for practical risk strati  cation strategies [[12](#_page19_x0.00_y413.87)]. Notably, recognising the dif  culty of accurate and consistent diagnosis of cirrhosis  [[13](#_page19_x0.00_y439.87)], the model was developed in patients with chronic hepatitis without speci  c reference to the presence or absence of cirrhosis. However, clinical application of such scores conventionally requires long-term validation studies in a setting similar to that in which the test would be applied.

We have access to data from a routine but rigorous surveillance programme in a district general hospital in Japan, in which all

relevant clinical and laboratory features have been prospectively recorded over more than 20 years. Speci  cally, the parameters necessary to calculate the aMAP score were recorded prior to the development of the outcome which the score aims to predict, namely HCC. We have previously undertaken detailed analysis of this programme showing that survival is signi  cantly better than in similar communities in Hong Kong and the UK, where surveillance programmes are not strictly implemented, even allowing for lead- time bias [[14](#_page19_x0.00_y457.87)]. This permits us, in effect, to judge the ef  cacy of the aMAP score in a robust manner thereby giving the opportunity to decrease the period between method (in this case, the aMAP score), discovery and practical implementation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

The Ogaki cohort

The present study included all patients without prior HCC, who were recruited to the HCC surveillance programme at the Ogaki Municipal Hospital between March 1998 and April 2014 and followed up until 2021. Ogaki Municipal Hospital is a general hospital serving a well-de  ned and stable local population of approximately 400,000. Of all HCC patients seen in this municipality, more than 70% were detected under surveillance [15[\]. ](#_page19_x0.00_y484.87)Data on all incident HCCs and mortality events occurring in this cohort were available through to March 2021. The diagnosis of HCC was made according to the European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines but the high incidence of resection meant that over 50% were con  rmed histologically. AFP levels greater than 20ng/mL or a positive US triggered a diagnostic workup for HCC with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnosis of chronic liver disease (CLD)/cirrhosis was established at the time of enrolment into the surveillance programme

by experienced clinicians using clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Henceforth, the presence or absence of cirrhosis refers to status on entry into the study although as noted below some of those in the no- cirrhosis  category did progress to cirrhosis during the follow-up period.

The aMAP score was calculated for each patient by applying the original formula [[12](#_page19_x0.00_y413.87)]:

aMAP risk score= ({0.06 age + 0.89 sex (Male: 1, Female: 0)

+ 0.48 [(log 10 bilirubin 0.66)
+ (albumin  −0.085)]− 0.01

` `platelets} + 7.4)/14.77 100

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were underpinned by survival analysis methods. Follow-up time began at the date of the  rst available aMAP score following entry into the HCC surveillance programme. This was de  ned as the  rst date at which the laboratory components of the aMAP score  i.e. platelet count, albumin and bilirubin  were measured simultaneously (i.e. from the same blood specimen). Follow-up time ended at the date of

de  nitive diagnoses of HCC (if at all), mortality (if at all) or the date of last clinic visit. Patients were de  ned as lost to follow-up if they were not known to have died by December 2020, and if they had not had a clinic visit in more than 12 months (i.e. last clinic visit prior to December 2019).

As recommended by best-practice guidelines [16[\], ](#_page19_x0.00_y511.87)the performance of the aMAP model was evaluated in terms of:

1. Discriminative ability (i.e. ability of aMAP to differentiate patients who develop HCC and those who do not) and
1. Calibration (i.e. agreement between the 5-year probability of HCC predicted by aMAP and the 5-year probability of HCC observed in the Ogaki cohort).

Discriminative ability of aMAP was  rst assessed visually, by plotting the Kaplan  Meier estimate of the survivor function for the low-, moderate- and high-risk aMAP groups. The cut off points for these three groups were based on those proposed in the original paper (i.e. <50 = low risk; 50  59= moderate risk; >60 = high risk). Secondly, we calculated the discriminative ability quantitatively using the concordance index (CI). In our base-case analysis, we used the standard Harrell s C-index; however, we also calculated the Wolbers-modi  ed version of the C-index assessing the impact of non-HCC mortality as a competing risk event. For all versions of the C-index, higher values indicate better discrimination. A C-index of 0.50 indicates zero discrimination (i.e. no better than chance), whereas a C- index of 1.0 indicates perfect discrimination.

Further, we assessed if the C-index of each prediction model varied according to selected patient characteristics. The characteristics were as follows: presence of cirrhosis at baseline; gender; age; liver disease aetiology and sustained virological response (SVR) status. Finally, we also calculated the discrimination of aMAP over various time horizons to assess if it performs better over shorter-term time periods versus longer-term time periods. The time horizons we considered were: 0  1, 0  2, 0  3, 0  4, 0  5, and 0  6 years after baseline.

The second aspect of model performance  Calibration  was assessed by comparing the 5-year probability of developing HCC with the observed proportions of individuals developing HCC in our cohort, using deciles of predicted risk. The predicted 5-year probability of aMAP was evaluated using the equation prescribed by the authors of the aMAP score, namely,

1− S0(t)exp(linear predictor) where t = X years, and S0(t) refers to the 5-year baseline survival function (S0(t)= 0.984). The 5-year observed HCC probability was based on Kaplan  Meier estimates of cumulative incidence. However, in a sensitivity analysis, this was alternatively de  ned as the 5-year cumulative incidence of HCC, accounting for non-HCC mortality as a competing risk event. A competing risk perspective ensures that the observed 5-year HCC probability is not overestimated, as can be the case with the standard Kaplan Meier estimate.

HCC mortality compared to the general population

We calculated the standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for liver cancer mortality according to the aMAP risk group. SMRs represent the ratio of the number of expected deaths to the number of observed deaths. Here the number of expected deaths was based on the number of liver cancer deaths one would expect to observe in the Ogaki cohort if the mortality rate was identical to that seen in the general population of Japan. All SMRs were adjusted for age, sex and calendar year. In this way, differences in the observed and expected number of deaths will be independent of differences in age/sex/calendar period between the Ogaki cohort and the general population. The total number of deaths from liver cancer in Japan, according to age, sex and calendar year was obtained from National Cancer Centre of Japan (h[ttps://ganjoho.jp/ reg_stat/index.html).](https://ganjoho.jp/reg_stat/index.html) Of note, SMRs were calculated for liver cancer mortality as opposed to HCC mortality because data for the latter were unavailable. However, the vast majority (>90%) of liver cancer deaths in Japan are from HCC [[17](#_page19_x0.00_y547.87)].

RESULTS

Characteristics of the sample

A total of 3479 patients met our inclusion criteria (i.e. all patients without prior HCC, who were recruited to the HCC surveillance programme at the Ogaki Municipal Hospital between March 1998 and April 2014). Six patients were excluded due to an unknown aMAP score. Thus, our  nal sample comprised 3473 patients.

In the  nal sample, the median age at baseline was 61.0 years with a similar proportion of males (49.4%) and females (50.6%). On entry into the surveillance programme, 55% of the patients in the were hepatitis C virus (HCV) seropositive, 24.1% were seropositive for hepatitis B virus and 21.3% had other forms of CLD (Table [1](#_page16_x24.00_y42.87)). Less than 1% of patients with HCV aetiology had achieved a sustained viral response at baseline. In contrast, by the end of follow-up, more than half of all HCV patients had achieved SVR (1026/1912; 53.7%)  mainly following direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens.

According to the  rst recorded aMAP score, approximately one third of the overall cohort fell into each of the three risk categories

as de  ned in the original publication (Table [2](#_page16_x24.00_y411.87))  low risk 27%, medium risk 41% and high risk 32%. However, patients with liver cirrhosis were heavily skewed towards the higher risk aMAP group (Table [2](#_page16_x24.00_y411.87)). Furthermore, it is inevitable that the aMAP score will change over time but such dynamic changes within the cohort together with changes in cirrhosis status will be considered in future studies.

Follow-up

The cohort was followed up for a total of 40,825-person years, equating to a mean-average of 11.8 years per patient (range 0.03

to 22.6 years). The median follow-up was 11.4 years, with an inter- quartile range of 7.7 to 15.7 years. There were 829 (24%) patients lost to follow-up at the date of study completion on the basis that they had not attended an appointment in more than 12 months despite not being known to have died (Fig. S1).

Of the 2587 who were classi  ed on clinical grounds as not having cirrhosis at study entry, 187 developed HCC during the course of the study. Of these 187, analysis of serially recorded FIB- 4 values suggested that 51% had become cirrhotic (FIB-4 >3.25) by the time they had HCC detected.

Incident HCC

During 40,825-person years of follow-up, 445 incident HCC events were observed. In the overall cohort, the crude incidence rate for HCC was 10.9 (95% CI: 9.9  12.0) events per 1000-person years follow-up. The crude incidence rate was 0.98, 7.05 and 29.1 events per 1000-person years for individuals in the low, moderate and high risk aMAP groups, respectively. Incidence was also consider- ably higher for cirrhosis patients (33.7 events per 1000-person

years) than non-cirrhosis patients (5.2 events as per 1000-person years).

Of note of the 2587 patients who were classi  ed, on clinical grounds, as not having cirrhosis on enrolment, 171 patients developed HCC during the course of the study. However, of these 171 patients, analysis of serially recorded FIB-4 values suggested that 54% had become cirrhotic (FIB-4 >3.25) by the time HCC was detected.

The median maximum tumour size at HCC diagnosis was 2cm, 77.8% were within Milan criteria and 69.4% (309 of 445) underwent treatment with curative intent (Table S1).

Mortality

The cause of death was recorded in >95% of cases permitting assessment of the impact of competing causes of death on the underlying aMAP assessment. In total, there were 184 deaths from primary liver cancer during follow-up, of which all were from HCC. The crude mortality rate for primary liver cancer mortality was 4.3 events per 1000-person years (95% CI: 3.7  5.0). There were 468

Model performance

Discrimination. Kaplan  Meier curves indicated signi  cant differ- ences in HCC incidence for low, moderate and high aMAP groups (p <0.0001; Fig. [1](#_page17_x24.00_y42.87)). Overall discrimination was consistent with those reported in the original aMAP publication, with a concordance index of 0.81 [95% CI: 0.79  0.82]. The Wolbers- modi  ed concordance index, accounting for non-HCC mortality as

a competing risk, was only marginally lower at 0.78 (95% CI: 0.76  0.80). Discrimination did not vary by liver disease aetiology. However, aMAP discriminated better in younger patients versus older patients, for males versus females, and for cirrhosis patients versus non-cirrhosis patients (See Table [3](#_page18_x24.00_y42.87)). For example, C-index was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.815, 0.930) for patients aged <51 years versus 0.73 (0.687, 0.763) for patients aged ≥68 years. aMAP also exhibited better discrimination over shorter prediction horizons   i.e. the C-index based only on data from the  rst year of follow- up was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.78  0.98) versus 0.81 (95% CI: 0.79  0.82) for all years of follow-up (Fig. S2). However,C-index values relating to the  rst 1  2 years of follow-up were imprecise, and thus these differences may merely re  ect sampling error.

Calibration. The model predicted 93.3% of patients to survive 5 years without developing HCC, while we observed 5-year HCC free survival in 95.8% of patients. The aMAP score tended to over- predict the 5-year risk of HCC slightly in our cohort, as shown by the calibration plot in Fig. [2](#_page18_x24.00_y332.87). The over-prediction appears to be worse at higher predicted risks of HCC. For example, in the highest risk decile, the mean 5-year HCC probability predicted by aMAP was 26.8%, whereas the observed 5-year Kaplan  Meier failure estimate was 16.5% (95% CI: 12.3  20.4%). A very similar picture

was evident when the 5-year observed probability was de  ned in terms of the cumulative incidence of HCC accounting for non-HCC mortality as a competing risk event (see Fig. S3).

Standardised mortality ratios. The number of deaths from liver cancer was 8.0 times higher than the general population (SMR: 8.0; 95% CI: 7.0  9.3). However, this varied from SMR:1.6 (95% CI: 0.4  6.3) in the low-risk aMAP group to SMR: 11.5 (95% CI: 9.7  13.5) in high-risk aMAP patients.

For patients with cirrhosis, the number of liver deaths was 17.2 times higher than the general population (SMR: 17.2: 95% CI: 14.6  21.3) (see Table [4](#_page18_x290.00_y331.87)).

DISCUSSION

Although the aMAP score has been validated in the original [12[\], ](#_page19_x0.00_y413.87)and subsequent publications [[18, ](#_page19_x0.00_y574.87)[19\], ](#_page19_x0.00_y601.87)and shown to be the best- performing of current HCC prediction models [[20\],](#_page19_x0.00_y628.87) its role has not yet been established in the prospective setting. Strictly speaking the approach adopted here is to test the aMAP algorithm for risk strati  cation in patients with chronic hepatitis but it cannot claim to be a prospective study insomuch as it was not undertaken explicitly to test aMAP performance in routine clinical surveillance practice. However, the dataset, as well as being completely independent, does overcome some of the limitations noted in the original publication and it has several unique features that render

it ideal for model evaluation.

First, although the aMAP score was not a stated objective, all the contributing parameters (variables within the model) were prospectively accrued prior to the detection of the outcome (HCC development) that the score aims to predict. Secondly, it provides important information about the performance of the model in a

` `real-world  setting. Thirdly, surveillance was applied in a district general hospital (as opposed to a specialist unit) in a rigorous

manner conforming to current international guidelines and in a setting with considerable expertise in both ultrasound examina- tion and radiological interpretation. The fact that the model is applicable to all patients with CLD, not simply cirrhosis, is also a strength although models for speci  c subgroups such as those achieving SVR may still be highly relevant [[21](#_page19_x0.00_y655.87)]. Current Western guidelines suggest that only patients with established cirrhosis (apart from certain high-risk groups ) should enter surveillance programmes. In this series our analysis implies that rigid con  nement to cirrhosis patients would result in missing about 38% of HCC cases although it should be noted that according to our FIB-4 results about half these patients will be cirrhotic by the time HCC has been detected. Since in most centres, only a minority of patients with CLD will be at the stage of cirrhosis a strategy of monitoring such patients for the development of cirrhosis and subsequent entry into a surveillance programme may need to be considered.

It might be considered that our study, being con  ned to a Japanese population, may be a limitation but any such validation needs to be undertaken in a population where surveillance is adequately implemented and, as documented elsewhere, this

rules out most western countries. The fact that nearly 70% of HCC cases in Ogaki were detected by surveillance and 70% of the HCC cases were detected at a potentially curative stage and actually received potentially curative therapy, attests that this cohort is as close to ideal for HCC surveillance as can be currently contemplated.

With these provisos and with the advantages as described above, our analysis completely con  rms the potential of the aMAP score to risk stratify CLD. The model performs well in all aetiologies, irrespective of gender and SVR status, although (similar to the original paper) it performs less well in the cirrhotic cohort and, as we show here, among younger patients. Our conclusions concerning the model performance after SVR should be treated with caution since a considerable period of time may have elapsed between recording the aMAP score on study entry, and achievement of SVR. However, we have recently con  rmed

British Journal of Cancer (2022) 127:1263 1269

the good performance of aMAP in a large series of HCV-cured patients from the UK [[20](#_page19_x0.00_y628.87)].

Appropriate HCC screening strategies for patients with cirrhosis who have been cured of HCV by the use of DAAs is currently a major clinical concern [[21](#_page19_x0.00_y655.87)  [25](#_page20_x0.00_y118.87)] as recently reviewed by Maan et al. [[26](#_page20_x0.00_y154.87)].

However, we believe that, in the light of our recent demonstration that the serum AFP levels are elevated many years before HCC detection, it is likely that the addition of this simple and widely available test (or the recently developed GALAD score [[27](#_page20_x0.00_y180.87), [28](#_page20_x0.00_y216.87)]) will improve the performance of aMAP and overcome the present model s limitations. The difference between the low risk group where there is a 1.3% incidence of HCC and the high risk group where the  gure was 37.4% is very striking and the discrimination, as assessed by the C -score was high and almost identical to the original publication. One caveat to note however is that calibration (i.e. agreement between predicted and observed risk) was not optimal, particularly for the highest risk patients where aMAP tended to over-predict the 5-year HCC risk. Thus, as with all prognostic models, aMAP may require recalibration according to geography and time period to ensure the predicted absolute risk of HCC is accurate. Inevitably, there will be loss to follow-up  in a study spanning >20 years and this may lead to some bias, but, in the event, a  gure of >75% for complete follow- up is remarkable [[29\].](#_page20_x0.00_y243.87)

Within any surveillance population, there will be underlying, associated and incidental causes of mortality that have the potential to in  uence any analysis of the programme. However, we show here that competing causes of death do not have a major impact on the model performance. Furthermore, any disadvantages of our study design are surely outweighed by the

` `immediacy  of the results. The limitations of formal prospective trials in terms of the long duration required and the changes in clinical practice that occur over the period of the trial is well illustrated by the recently reported UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS)[ \[30](#_page20_x0.00_y270.87)]. This trial involved 200,000 patients and took over 16 years to complete. In the face of negative  ndings, the authors opined that it would be at least another decade before a further trial could lead to implementa- tion of a practice-changing screening programme.

Our assessment of SMRs in each aMAP class has important implications for practical implementation of HCC surveillance. Identi  cation of subgroups that do not bene  t from surveillance and may be excluded from the harms related thereto is a realistic possibility. The  gure of 1.7 (albeit with wide con  dence intervals) as the SMR for the lowest risk group implies a 70% higher risk of death from HCC (than in the general population) and at  rst sight this may appear very signi  cant but it should be remembered

`  `rstly, that some of the increased risk of death will be associated with the attendant CLD which a screening programme could not

be expected to affect. Secondly, relative   gures such as SMR need to be considered in relation to the baseline risk. If the baseline risk to a member of the general population is very low, then a 70% increase may not necessarily be considered unacceptable.

The impact of changes in treatment/management methods introduced over the past 20 years both for the underlying liver disease (nucleoside analogues for HBV, interferon and interferon-free regimens for HCC and general principles such as alcohol avoidance and control of obesity) and the actual HCC (better systemic therapy, for example) can all be investigated within the present cohort. All the additional data required for such model re  nement is available and we are currently investigating this possibility. Our analysis suggests the aMAP score possesses all the qualities required for practical risk strati  cation in HCC surveillance [\[31](#_page20_x0.00_y306.87)].

In conclusion, although it is apparent that certain very low-risk groups are inde  nable, the categorisation as low, intermediate and high is arbitrary and the application of aMAP as a continuous

variable may be even more revealing. Furthermore, the categor- isation of patients as cirrhotic/non-cirrhotic may be simplistic, not allowing for changes in change in degree of  brosis over time. With these caveats, analysis of this large, prospectively accrued cohort suggest that the aMAP model offers a simple yet robust approach to HCC risk assessment in patients with CLD.

**Liver cirrhotic patients suffer from a seemingly unpredictable risk of hepatocellular carcinoma** 

**(HCC). Here, an HCC risk score *R* (0   *R*   1) was derived from commonly tested haematological and biochemical parameters. In the score-derivation Taiwanese cohort (144 cirrhosis versus 48 HCC- remission patients), the score had an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.70 (95% confidence interval** 

**[CI], 0.61–0.78, P** < **0.001). When validated in a Korean cohort (78 cirrhosis versus 23 HCC-remission patients), the AUC was 0.68 (CI, 0.56–0.80, P** = **0.009). In a multicentre prospective cohort (478 cirrhotic patients prospectively followed for HCC occurrence), the hazard ratio with respect to *R* was 2.344** 

**(CI** = **1.183–4.646, P** = **0.015). The cumulative incidences of HCC at two years after patient enrolment were 9.6% and 1.7% for the high-risk (*R*   0.5) and low-risk (*R*** < **0.5) groups, respectively (P** < **0.001).** 

**At the end of the study, the incidences were 10.9% and 5.0%, respectively (P** = **0.012). The majority** 

**of HCCs (23/26) in the high-risk group emerged within the first two years of follow-up. In conclusion, an HCC risk score was developed for cirrhotic patients that effectively predicted HCC in a prospective** 

**cohort study.**

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common solid malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide[1](#_page29_x155.00_y447.36). HCC oncogenesis is a complex process involving multiple aetiologies, including chronic hepatitis B (CHB)[2](#_page29_x155.00_y464.36), chronic hepatitis C (CHC)[3](#_page29_x155.00_y472.36), diabetes[4](#_page29_x155.00_y489.36), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis[5](#_page29_x155.00_y506.36), obesity, and alcoholic liver disease[s6](#_page29_x155.00_y523.36). Viral hepatitis is the predominant aetiology of HCC in Asia due to the high prevalence of CHB and CHC. Fortunately, the prevalence of CHB is decreasing due to the consistent execution of mass vaccina- tion programmes in areas such as Taiwan[7](#_page29_x155.00_y532.36) and South Korea[8](#_page29_x155.00_y540.36). Additionally, potent antiviral treatments have been developed and widely used for the treatment of CHB[2](#_page29_x155.00_y464.36) and CHC[3](#_page29_x155.00_y472.36). As viral hepatitis has been gradually brought under control, non-viral factors involved in the occurrence of HCC are gaining increasing attention.

Liver cirrhosis o en precedes the occurrence of HCC. Liver cirrhotic patients suffer from an increased yet seemingly unpredictable risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. A prospective study in Japan demonstrated that the three-year cumulative risk of liver cancer was 12.5% in cirrhotic patients, which is in contrast to 3.8% in non-cirrhotic hepatitis patients9[.](#_page29_x155.00_y557.36)  us, precautionary measures of HCC, such as regular surveillance by ultra-      sonography, are critical in cirrhotic patients. In U.S.[6](#_page29_x155.00_y523.36) and European[10](#_page29_x155.00_y574.36) guidelines, it is suggested that one or more screenings by ultrasonography or computer tomography should be performed per year for cirrhosis patients. A recent study in Taiwan demonstrated that mass screening by ultrasonography improved early detection of HCC and thus reduced the associated mortality[11.](#_page29_x155.00_y591.36) However, a sonography screening programme requires intensive 

labour from radiologists or clinical hepatologists and is therefore economically and pragmatically unachievable.

An efficient and cost-effective screening method for early or even  imminent  HCC remains an unmet medical need.

A few exploratory-stage biomarkers have been reported to discern HCC from cirrhosis. A prospective study on 114 hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis patients revealed that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is inversely correlated with the onset of HCC[12](#_page29_x155.00_y608.36).  e reduction of IGF-1 level preceded the diagnosis of HCC by 9.3 months12[. ](#_page29_x155.00_y608.36)A retrospective, exploratory comparison of HCC and cirrhotic patients revealed that fucosylated kininogen, fucosylated α-1-antitrypsin and Golgi protein 73 can all distinguish HCC from cirrhotic patients, particularly when these biomarkers are combined together [13](#_page29_x155.00_y625.36). Serum asialo-alpha1-acid glycoprotein concentrations were also found to be indicative of HCC among cirrhotic patients[14](#_page29_x155.00_y642.36). Another glycoprotein, clusterin, was shown to be elevated in HCC compared with HBV-related cirrhosis[15](#_page29_x155.00_y659.36). Additionally, a nomogram was developed for hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis patients to predict HCC occurrence [16](#_page29_x155.00_y676.36). With the exception of the first study (IGF-1), all these studies were performed in a retrospective manner and demonstrated the ability to discern established HCC from cirrhosis.  e performance of these markers in the prospective prediction of HCC occurrence in liver cirrhosis patients is unknown.

We were thus motivated to derive an HCC risk score using commonly evaluated haematological and biochem- ical factors and validate the score in a prospective study.  is risk score did not incorporate virological factors because a great majority of cirrhosis patients are currently undergoing effective antiviral treatments, and thus, in most of these patients, the virological factors cannot be assessed. Previously established risk scores that included virological factors, such as viral loads and viral genotypes, could no longer be calculate[d17](#_page29_x155.00_y693.36).

**Methods**

**Patients.**  is study was conducted under the approval of Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Medical Center, Taiwan and Yonsei University College of Medicine, Korea. Taiwanese patients were recruited from three sites: Keelung, Linkou and Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospitals (which are located in the northern, central-northern and southern parts of Taiwan, respectively). Korean patients were recruited from the Yonsei University Severacne Hospital (See Fig[. 1](#_page22_x155.00_y321.36) for deposition for all patients enrolled). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients enrolled, and the study was conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the applicable laws and regulations. A two-step design was devised.  e first step 

was a cross-sectional analysis where patients were enrolled in Taiwan (N = 192) and Korea (N = 101) for score derivation and validation, respectively (Table[ 1](#_page23_x153.00_y45.36)).  e scores were calculated using baseline haematological and biochemical data, which were assayed at recruitment.  e Taiwanese cohort comprised 144 liver cirrhosis patients who never developed HCC and 48 liver cirrhosis patients who were diagnosed as early stage HCC (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC] stage A) and had achieved complete remission a er surgical resections.  e Korean cohort comprised 78 liver cirrhotic patients and 23 HCC patients.

` `e second step was a prospective study, where 143 liver cirrhosis patients of the Taiwanese cohort and 62 of the Korean cohort were subsequently followed for at least 3 months (Fig.[ 1](#_page22_x155.00_y321.36)). An independent, non-overlapping cohort of 273 liver cirrhotic patients was also enrolled, increasing the number of prospectively followed patients ![ref3]

to 478 (Fig.[ 1](#_page22_x155.00_y321.36)).  ese patients were all enrolled between January, 2013 and December, 2015 and subsequently fol- lowed until March, 2017, or the occurrence of HCC, whichever came first. Patients who developed HCC within the first three month of follow-up were excluded from the analysis. Baseline measurements were performed at the time of enrolment, and the HCC risk score derived from the first step was calculated using these baseline measurements.

Cirrhosis was diagnosed by either (i) liver biopsy or (ii) ultrasonography imaging criteria[18](#_page29_x155.00_y710.36) plus one of the following: the presence of oesophageal varices by endoscopy, a Fibroscan stiffness value > 12 kPa, or aspar- tate transaminase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) > 1. In CHB-related cirrhosis patients, life-long antiviral treatment was provided if HBV DNA level > 2000 IU/mL was detected. When included in this study, all CHB patients had HBV DNA level < 500 IU/mL.  e efficacy of peg-interferon-based antiviral therapy in CHC-related 

cirrhotic patients was not satisfactory, and the side effects outweighed its benefit. Direct-acting antivirals were not covered by health insurance in Taiwan until 2017.  us, the CHC-related cirrhosis patients included in this study were not treated.  ese patients were in a transitional period and were waiting for insurance coverage of direct-acting antivirals.

All patients were under ultrasound surveillance (liver ultrasound examination once every three months). If the ultrasound examination was positive for liver nodule(s), then a full spectrum of examinations, including dynamic computed tomography, was performed.

HCC was diagnosed by one of the following methods: (i) echo-guided liver biopsy or fine-needle aspiration cytology, (ii) alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) > 200 ng/mL, tumour > 2 cm and typical HCC characteristics in dynamic 

computed tomography, or (iii) typical HCC characteristics in both dynamic computed tomography and angi- ography. Complete remission of HCC a er treatment was determined by absence of HCC in two consecutive computed tomography examinations at least 3 months apart a er therapy.

**Clinical parameters included for biosignature discovery.**  The following 40 clinical parameters and 7 derived variables were included for establishment of an HCC risk score in cirrhotic patients (Table[ 2](#_page24_x153.00_y45.36)). Biochemistry variables included aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), bilirubin, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), haptoglobin, sugar before meal (sugar AC), glycohaemoglobin, free thyroxin (T4), total protein, albumin, alpha1-globulin, alpha2-globulin, beta-globulin, gamma-globulin, albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio, apolipoprotein-A1 (Apo-A1), C-reactive protein (CRP), uric acid (UA), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), cholesterol, triglyceride, cholesterol/HDL ratio, LDL/HDL ratio, insulin, ferritin, ceruloplasmin, iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC), complement component 3 (C3), complement component 4 (C4), sugar/insulin ratio, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Haemogram variables included leukocyte, haemoglobin, platelet, percentage of neutrophil, per- centage of lymphocyte, percentage of monocytes, lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio, log lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio, and prothrombin time (PT).

**Statistical analysis.**  Clinical variables in different patient groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney test and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). Confounding effects of risk scores were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Longitudinal time-to-HCC values of different patient strata were compared using the log-rank test and visualized using the Kaplan-Meier plot.  e Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios and confidence intervals of the HCC risk score. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. SPSS so ware was used for statistical analysis (IBM, Armonk, NY).

` `e multivariate risk score was derived using the generalized iterative modelling (GIM) algorithm, which was published previousl[y19](#_page30_x155.00_y46.36). Briefly, GIM shares three similar components with conventional generalized linear models: (1) a **polynomial** combination of variables, denoted as t; (2) a link function connecting the values of t to the response variable R; and (3) a goal of optimization.  e major difference between GIM and generalized linear models lies in (1), where t in a generalized linear model is defined as a **linear** combination of variables joined together by weighted additions  +  regardless of whether the variables are selected manually or by a stepwise 

method, such as forward or backward stepwise regressions. In contrast, t in GIM is defined as a **polynomial** combination of variables joined together by algebraic operations (i.e., addition  +  and multiplication  × ). 

` `e variables are then weighted by coefficients (b1, b2, b3￿.), which are rational numbers.  e multiplication of variables allows the exploration of synergistic effects between variables. In this study, we used a logistic function 

as the link function and the U-statistics as the goal of optimization.

**Results**

**HCC risk score derived from common biochemical and haematological variables.**  Basic demo- graphic information about the study subjects is listed in Table [1](#_page23_x153.00_y45.36). In the cross-sectional analysis, 48 HCC patients (under remission) and 144 liver cirrhotic patients were recruited in Taiwan (Fig. [1](#_page22_x155.00_y321.36)).  is sample size was of suffi- cient statistical power based on an estimation shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. To develop an HCC risk score, 47 commonly tested biochemical and hepatological variables were analysed, and the AUC and P-values for asymp- totic significance are listed in Table[ 2](#_page24_x153.00_y45.36). Ten clinical variables reached statistical significance, including platelet ![ref3]

(PLT), HDL, insulin, HOMA-IR, lymphocyte percentage, neutrophil percentage, sugar/insulin ratio (SIR) and lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio (LNR) in both the original and logarithmic forms. Using the GIM algorithm, a model of the HCC risk score (R) was derived from the above variables.

R was defined as a logistic function of t:

R = et/(et + 1) (1) where t is a function of clinical variables:

t = −0.005 × PLT − 0.029 × HDL− 0.376 × log10(SIR) + 0.854 × log10(LNR)

−0.015 × PLT× LNR − 0.062 × SIR× LNR + 4.253 (2)

` `e value of t was determined by weighted addition of clinical variables and the multiplication of variables (such as PLT × LNR and SIR × LNR), a feature that distinguishes the GIM methodology from conventional generalized lin-

ear models.  e constant term of the model was manually adjusted, making the median risk score of the 144 cirrhotic patients 0.5.  e AUC was 70% (P < 0.001, Fig. 2[A). ](#_page26_x155.00_y607.36) e 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile HCC risk scores 

of the cirrhotic patients were 0.275, 0.5 and 0.65, respectively. In contrast, those values in the HCC group were 0.5, 0.64 and 0.75, respectively (Fig[. 2B](#_page26_x155.00_y607.36)). In view of risk score distribution of the two groups, we considered liver cirrhotic patients with an HCC risk score (R) < 0.5 to carry a low risk and patients with a risk score   0.5 to carry a high risk.

A er the model was constructed, we created two Apps called QuickMed that are freely downloadable online for calculating the HCC risks conveniently in iPhones and Android devices.  e model has not been changed.

**Cross-sectional validation of the HCC risk score.**  An independent cohort of liver cirrhotic (N = 78) and HCC (N = 23) patients was recruited in Korea to validate the performance of the HCC risk score.  e AUC was 68% (P = 0.009, Fig[. 2C](#_page26_x155.00_y607.36)), suggesting that the HCC risk model was applicable to patients of another ethnicity in Asia.

**Prospective validation of the HCC risk score.**  Among liver cirrhosis patients in the cross-sectional analy- sis, 143 patients of the Taiwanese cohort and 62 patients of the Korean cohort were subsequently followed for at least 3 months (Fig.[ 1](#_page22_x155.00_y321.36)).  e median follow-up time of those patients who did not develop HCC was 1385.5 [131~1499] days.  e median follow-up time of those with HCC was 334 [105~1238] days. Additionally, an independent cohort of 273 cirrhotic patients was recruited exclusively for the prospective analysis.  e median follow-up time of those without HCC was 1340 [378~1483] days.  e median follow-up time of those with HCC was 514 [120~1224] 

days. Cox proportional hazards model analysis on all these prospectively followed patients (total N = 478) revealed that the hazard ratio with respect to R was 2.344 (CI = 1.183 4.646, P = 0.015). Patients were stratified into different risk groups according to the risk scores. At the end of the second year, 23/239 (9.6%) and 4/239 (1.7%) patients in the high-risk (R   0.5) and low-risk (R < 0.5) groups developed HCC (log-rank P < 0.001, Fig. 3[A).](#_page27_x155.00_y610.36) At the end of this study, 26/239 (10.9%) and 12/239 (5.0%) patients in the high- and low-risk groups develope[d ](#_page27_x155.00_y610.36)HCCs (log-rank P = 0.012, Fig.[ 3A)](#_page27_x155.00_y610.36).  e majority of HCCs in the high-risk group emerged within the first two years of follow-up (23/26 [88.5%]), whereas HCC in the low-risk group occurred mostly a er the second year (8/12 [66.7%]) and was associated with chronic hepatitis C (6/8 [75%]). When we further stratified the high-risk patients into two groups (R   0.65 and 0.5 ≤ R < 0.65), the three strata manifested distinct cumulative incidence (P = 0.008, Fig. 3[B)](#_page27_x155.00_y610.36). Patients in the highest (R   0.65) and lowest risk (R < 0.5) groups also exhibited distinct cumulative incidence[ (](#_page27_x155.00_y610.36)P = 0.002).  e relationship between R and the observed occurrence of HCC is summarized in Table 3.

We further analysed the subgroups of patients with the two dominant viral aetiologies. At the end of the second year, the high- and low-risk strata of patients with positive HBsAg at baseline manifested a distinct cumu- lative incidence (P = 0.001, Fig.[ 4A](#_page28_x155.00_y398.36)). Similarly, patients with positive anti-HCV antibodies exhibited different cumulative incidences (P = 0.016, Fig[. 4C](#_page28_x155.00_y398.36)). At the end of the study, cumulative incidence of the high- and low-risk strata of positive-HBsAg patients remained different (P = 0.002, Fig.[ 4B](#_page28_x155.00_y398.36)). In contrast, the difference in patients with positive anti-HCV antibodies was lost (P = 0.313, Fig.[ 4D](#_page28_x155.00_y398.36)).

**Evaluation of the age and gender factors for risk assessment.**  Age and gender are two well-known risk factors of HCC despite the fact that their associated risk could not be mitigated by medical interventions. In 

fact, these two factors plus AST could already establish a risk prediction mode[l19](#_page30_x155.00_y46.36). In the REVEAL-HBV study, age and gender were incorporated into an HCC risk model established for non-cirrhotic, hepatitis B-infected patients[17](#_page29_x155.00_y693.36). Here, we examined whether the predictive value was improved when these two factors were incorpo- rated into our HCC risk score R for cirrhosis patients. First, we employed the same risk score assignment as that used in the REVEAL-HBV study and produced the age-gender score.  is score was increased by 1 for every 5-year increment of age starting from the minimum age of the cohort (31 years old), increased by 2 if the patient was male, and remained unchanged if the patient was female.  e age-gender score thus retained the relative weighting of the two factors to be consistent with previous studies. Second, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the confounding effects of R or age-gender score in the cross-sectional analysis (Taiwanese and Korean cohorts combined, N = 293). Both scores were independently associated with HCC (R: adjusted P < 0.001, age-gender score: adjusted P = 0.001, Supplementary Table 1). A combined risk score was thus 

established by use of the multivariate logistic equation incorporating both R and the age-gender score as follows: Combined RiskScore = eu/(eu + 1); u = 2.601617 × R+ 0.213362

× (age− gender score) − 4.378152.![ref3]

Nevertheless, this improvement did not achieve statistical significance (P = 0.452 and 0.137, respectively).  e high- and low-risk strata determined by R manifested significantly different cumulative ![ref3]

**Discussion**

In the present study, we discovered that the HCC risk of a liver cirrhotic patient could be calculated by commonly tested hepatological and biochemical factors, which were shown to be predictive of subsequent HCC events in a prospective study.  is score could be easily evaluated in an ordinary medical facility.  is score was derived with a purpose of improving the current sonography-alone screening strategy where the compliance was not satisfactory. With such a score in place, intensive sonography screening can be applied exclusively to the high-risk patients, whereas haematological and biochemical assays can be performed on the lower risk patients on a regular basis until the score indicates a high-risk stage.

Observations in the prospective study supported the proposed screening strategy incorporating the HCC score derived from haematological and biochemical factors. Most HCCs in high-risk patients emerged within the first two years of follow-up, whereas most HCCs in low-risk patients emerged a er the second year of follow-up. At the end of the second year, the accumulated incidences of HCCs between the two groups exhibited the greatest difference (Fig.[ 3A](#_page27_x155.00_y610.36)).  e 6 components of this risk score may change with time; thus, the score itself could also be altered with time. In low-risk patients, the score could increase in some patients a er two years of follow-up. IN contrast, among high-risk patients, those who did not develop HCC in the first two years might exhibit a decreas- ing risk score therea er. If R < 0.5, the patient is allowed to repeat this test 1 2 years later, carrying a yearly HCC risk of <1%. However, if R   0.5, the patients should be urged to accept intensive ultrasound surveillance given that the HCC risk is estimated as >5%/year.

Interestingly, when we performed the subgroup analysis of patients with two dominant viral aetiologies, we found that R was predictive in chronic hepatitis B patients at the 2-year and 4-year follow-up (P = 0.001 and 

0\.002, respectively, Fig[. 4A,B](#_page28_x155.00_y398.36)). In contrast, R was predictive in chronic hepatitis C patients only at the 2-year follow-up (P = 0.016, Fig.[ 4C](#_page28_x155.00_y398.36)) but not at the 4-year follow-up (P = 0.313, Fig.[ 4D](#_page28_x155.00_y398.36)).  e reasons for this phenom-

enon were unknown at this time. Currently, antiviral therapy can either suppress viral replication, such as that noted in CHB infection, or it can completely eradicate viral hepatitis, such as that noted in CHC infection. Viral suppression in CHB could impede the occurrence of HCC as demonstrated by a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of lamivudine for [CHB20](#_page30_x155.00_y63.36).![ref3]

A recent retrospective study also revealed a significant reduction in HCC risk following the availability of antiviral therapy[21](#_page30_x155.00_y80.36). Such a HCC-preventive effect by antiviral treatment however remained debatable in cirrhotic patients.  e beneficial effect of lamivudine could be compromised with the development of drug resistance20[.

On the other hand, interferon-based antiviral or direct-acting antiviral therapy could eradicate CHC infection and thus signif- icantly reduce HCC risk. However, the therapeutic efficacy for interferon-based treatment was greatly reduced in patients with liver cirrhosis, and recent studies demonstrated that direct-acting antiviral therapy could increase HCC risk in cirrhosis patients[24](#_page30_x155.00_y140.36)[,25](#_page30_x155.00_y157.36).  us, HCC continued to develop in cirrhosis patients despite rapid advances in antiviral therapy, and HCC surveillance in cirrhosis patients remained mandatory in clinical practice.

Of the six components of this score, insulin/sugar ratio is related to diabetes, HDL is related to lipid metab- olism, platelet count is associated with severity of fibrosis, and lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio is associated with clinical outcomes in many cancers, including HCC.  ese components are all known risk or prognosis factors in oncogenesis of HCC; thus, our results were consistent with these studies.

AFP is generally considered a diagnosis biomarker. However, some studies demonstrated that increased AFP could predict HCC occurrence. However, in our initial univariate analysis for score development (Table[ 2](#_page24_x153.00_y45.36)), AFP was not a significant predictor. Our HCC-remission group included patients with early HCC who achieved com- plete tumour eradication, which was demonstrated by computed tomography. Using this approach, AFP exhib- ited no significant difference between the HCC remission and cirrhotic groups. It is unclear why some studies revealed that higher AFP levels could be a predictor for HCC. It remains possible that patients with increased AFP could have already developed micro-HCC lesions that were too small to be detected. Such patients should still be considered carrying a high risk for HCC development.

` `is study was limited by a relatively small sample size compared with many retrospective studies1[9. ](#_page30_x155.00_y46.36)Despite the collaboration of multiple medical centres in Taiwan and South Korea, recruitment of liver cirrhotic patients for a longitudinal follow-up was still difficult.  e number of patients for this prospective study was less than 500. 

` `erefore, we could only stratify the risk into 2 4 levels.  e estimation of subtle risk difference with increased resolution may require a larger sample size. However, the main purpose of establishing this score is to distinguish between patients who have a high risk of imminent HCC and those harboring a low risk.  e high-risk patients would be urged to receive more frequent ultrasound examination, while those with low-risks can receive the same hematological and biochemical examinations routinely (if ultrasound surveillance is difficult to implement), until the score indicates a high risk. Hence, this score is not for a final diagnosis of HCC and an AUROC of ~70% is acceptable. It may be difficult to further improve the AUROC based on current knowledge. A major reason is that some of the cirrhosis patients (no HCC developed during this study) could still develop HCC in the future follow-ups.

In conclusion, we have developed an HCC risk score exclusively composed of commonly tested clinical parameters.  e risk score effectively predicted HCC occurrence in cirrhosis patients in a longitudinal prospec- tive follow-up study combining Taiwanese and Korean patients.

Using a model-based approach, we estimated the probability that an individual, with a specified combination of risk factors, would develop lung cancer within a 5-year period.

Data from 579 lung cancer cases and 1157 age- and sex-matched population-based controls were available for this analysis. Significant risk factors were fitted into multivariate conditional logistic regression models. The final multivariate model was combined with age- standardised lung cancer incidence data to calculate absolute risk estimates.

Combinations of lifestyle risk factors were modelled to create risk profiles. For example, a 77-year-old male non-smoker, with a family history of lung cancer (early onset) and occupational exposure to asbestos has an absolute risk of 3.17% (95% CI, 1.67 5.95). Choosing a 2.5% cutoff to trigger increased surveillance, gave a sensitivity of 0.62 and specificity of 0.70, while a 6.0% cutoff gave a sensitivity of 0.34 and specificity of 0.90. A 10-fold cross validation produced an AUC statistic of 0.70, indicating good discrimination. If independent validation studies confirm these results, the LLP risk models  application as the first stage in an early detection strategy is a logical evolution in patient care.

In addition, being the most common cancer with over 1.3 million for lung cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To be included in the LLP case control study, incident cases of histologically or cytologically confirmed lung cancer were between 20 and 80 years of age. Lung cancer included cancer in any of the topographic subcategories of code C34 according to the Inter- national Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision. Participants were eligible for inclusion provided they were resident within the Liverpool area and gave informed consent for baseline interviews. Both cases and controls were ineligible for the study if they had a previous cancer within 5-years of interview date (excluding melanoma). Two population controls per case were selected from registers of general practitioners in Liverpool and matched to lung

cancer cases by year of birth (±2 years) and gender.

A standardised lifestyle questionnaire was used to collect detailed information on socioeconomic and demographic char- acteristics, medical history, family history of cancer, history of tobacco consumption and lifetime occupational history. Extensive information about tobacco smoking was elicited for all partici- pants including smoking status, inhalation, type of cigarette smoked, number of cigarettes smoked per day, age at start and end. An ever smoker was defined as someone who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and a current smoker was defined as a participant who reported smoking 2 years prior to the date of the interview. During the interview, all periods of consumption were defined and counted towards total exposure.

Information on history of cancer among first degree relatives (i.e. parents, brothers and sisters and biological children) was recorded, including age of diagnosis, site of cancer and relation to the participant. All participants were asked if they had ever been told by a physician that they had a prior non-malignant lung disease such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, pneumonia or tuberculosis at any age at least 2 years before any diagnosis of lung cancer (or date of interview for controls). Furthermore, if participants had ever been diagnosed with a malignant tumour, the primary site was recorded, and their age at the time of diagnosis.

The methodology to assess occupational exposure was based on that used by [Siemiatycki et al (1991)](#_page36_x0.00_y289.00) and has been decribed previously ([Cassidy et al, 2007b).](#_page36_x0.00_y163.00) Briefly, asbestos exposure was determined firstly by collecting detailed information on each job held using general and specialised questionnaires. Each job was then assessed by an expert, who indicated their confidence in the presence of exposure (categorised as possible, probable or certain). Asbestos exposure was further assessed by frequency of exposure, defined as the percentage of working time exposed (categorised as 1 5, 5 30 or 430%), and intensity of exposure (categorised as low, medium or high). To adhere to the study s secondary objective that only variables readily available to clinicians were included, we characterised asbestos exposure as present if an individual was exposed for at least 1 year during their working life.

The study protocol was approved by the Liverpool Research Ethic Committee and all research participants provided written, informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Statistical analyses

Distributions in demographic variables between cases and controls were evaluated by the w2 test. Differences between cases and

controls in age and self-reported pack-years were tested using the Student s t-test. When the data distribution significantly deviated from normal, the Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed. The risk model was developed using conditional logistic regression. The multivariate model was built up in two phases. First, all statistically significant covariates (Po0.05) in univariate analyses were

included in a multivariate model, and backward stepwise regression was performed, whereby those factors losing their significance (P40.05) in the multivariate analysis were dropped. Those factors not significant in the univariate analyses were subsequently fitted to the multivariate model, with adjustment for the remaining significant effects, to detect effects, which are only seen when the major risk factors are accounted for. Pairwise interaction tests were conducted between all the risk factors in the final multivariate model to ensure that they did not modify each other s effects. Once the final multivariate model was determined, the logistic model was converted to absolute risk using the method described in the Appendix. The classification power for the model was determined by means of a 10-fold cross-validation procedure and by calculations of area under the curve (AUC) in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA release 9.0 ([Stata Corporation, 2005)](#_page36_x0.00_y343.00). 

RESULTS ![ref7]

Five hundred and seventy-nine incident cases of lung cancer and 1157 population controls were recruited between 1998 and 2005. Overall, the response rate was 58.3% for cases and 61.5% for controls. Caucasians represented approximately 99% of both the cases and the controls. The majority of lung cancer cases in the study population presented with non small cell lung cancer (83.2%). [Table 1](#_page32_x290.00_y370.00) shows the distribution of study-specific risk factors between cases and controls. Men constituted the majority of the cases (61.7%) and, accordingly the controls (61.6%). The proportion of ever smokers was significantly higher in cases (95.3%) compared with controls (71%).

No significant effect of marital status, education or socio- economic status was observed on lung cancer risk after adjustment for smoking. There was a significant increase in risk amongst individuals with a prior diagnosis of pneumonia both before (odds ratio (OR) ¼1.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21 2.17) and after adjustment for smoking (OR ¼1.70, 95% CI: 1.21 2.39). Participants with a prior diagnosis of emphysema had a significant increase in risk before adjustment (OR ¼2.19, 95% CI: 1.25 3.84) but not after (OR ¼1.78, 95% CI: 0.96 3.30). No effect was present for prior asthma, bronchitis and tuberculosis. Sex-specific analyses indicated that the risk of lung cancer remained significantly elevated for males who had a prior diagnosis of pneumonia (OR¼1.92, 95% CI: 1.25 2.95), but not for females (OR ¼1.30, 95% CI: 0.73 2.29). Women who had a prior diagnosis of emphysema exhibited a significantly increased lung cancer risk (OR¼2.72, 95% CI: 1.70 3.70), which was not observed in males (OR¼1.30, 95% CI: 0.58 2.94). Physician-diagnosed prior cancer was associated with a significantly increased lung cancer risk (OR¼2.18, 95% CI: 1.39 3.42) after adjustment for age, sex and smoking. The majority of reported previous cancers were cancers of the skin, which were associated with a 2.2-fold increased lung cancer risk (95% CI: 1.12 4.26) followed by cancers of the breast (OR¼4.81, 95% CI: 1.43 16.15). Although there was a significant trend of increasing risk with numbers of affected relatives, there was no significant effect of family history (any vs none) of lung cancer in the study population overall or in late-onset cases, regardless of the age of affected relatives. There was, however, a substantial and statistically significant increase in risk where both the lung cancer case and the affected relative were diagnosed with lung cancer before the age of 60 years (OR ¼4.89, 95% CI: 1.47 16.25). Significantly elevated odds ratios were also observed in connection with an affected relative diagnosed before age 60 regardless of age-at-onset of the case (OR ¼2.08, 95% CI: 1.20 3.59) ([Cassidy et al, 2006).](#_page36_x0.00_y208.00) Current smokers (OR ¼13.15, 95% CI: 8.43 20.50) were at higher risk than ex-smokers (OR ¼5.72, 95% CI: 3.71 8.82). Fitting total years of smoking duration as a continuous covariate, and in 10- and 20-year intervals revealed a steady increase in lung cancer risk. There was a steady increase in risk with increasing pack-years and average amount smoked,

although in neither case was as large as that with smoking duration. A significant dose response effect was observed for the daily number of cigarettes (Po0.0001), smoking duration (Po0.0001) and smoking pack-years (Po0.0001). No association was found between smoking pipes or cigars and risk of lung cancer. A significant increase in risk was observed for those who reported ever exposure to spousal tobacco smoke (OR ¼1.44, 95% CI: 1.04 1.98). A significant dose response effect was observed with duration of exposure (P¼0.01), with the largest increase in risk in the highest exposed group corresponding to more than 50 years of exposure (OR ¼2.51, 95% CI: 1.33 4.71). A nonsignificant excess risk was observed for ever exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace (OR ¼1.29, 95% CI: 0.97 1.73). However, when analysed by duration of exposure, a dose response effect was not observed (P¼0.83). There was no evidence of elevated risk of lung cancer due to exposure to secondhand smoke from social sources. The high lifetime exposure prevalence to asbestos seen in this study is manifest as an overall risk of 1.88 (OR ¼1.88, 95% CI: 1.36 2.59), which was reduced after adjustment for occupational confounders to 1.51 (95% CI: 1.02 2.04).

The final multivariate logistic regression model is presented in [Table 2.](#_page33_x34.00_y498.00) Significantly increased risks in the multivariate analysis were observed for family history of lung cancer (with particularly high risk in those with a relative aged under 60 at diagnosis of lung cancer) (P¼0.01), prior diagnosis of pneumonia (P¼0.002), prior diagnosis of cancer other than lung (P¼0.005), occupational exposure to asbestos (Po0.001) and duration of smoking (Po0.001). We observed significant interaction between a prior diagnosis of pneumonia and prior diagnosis of malignant tumour (P¼0.04), which lost significance when adjusted for other risk factors in the multivariate model (P¼0.07). Although various measures of smoking were significant in the univariate analysis, only duration of smoking remained significant in the multivariate model. An association between a prior diagnosis of emphysema and lung cancer also lost significance in the multivariate model.

Using the methods described in the Appendix, the absolute risk of lung cancer within a 5-year period was calculated. The diversity of these estimates can be illustrated by comparing a smoker and nonsmoker of similar age. First, the absolute risk for a man aged 77 with a family history of lung cancer (relative aged under 60 at diagnosis), a history of asbestos exposure and no other risk factors

is 3.17% (95% CI, 1.67 5.95). Secondly, a man with the same risk factor profile plus a 45-year smoking history has an absolute risk of 28.68% (95% CI, 15.07 47.67). In these examples, smoking

DISCUSSION

0\.50

By combining case control data with regional incidence rates, we have developed a model to project individual 5-year absolute risks of developing lung cancer. The model has the potential to identify high-risk individuals by focusing on information that can be readily obtained in the primary care setting. The LLP risk model also appears to discriminate between high and low risk, although it will require rigorous validation in separate populations. As well as

The LLP risk model estimates also illustrate how a substantial the model did not change irrespective of whether 10- or 20-year risk can be conferred by risk factors other than smoking. Consider categories were added. Therefore, the broadest category of a 67-year-old man who has never smoked, but who has a family smoking duration (20 years) was chosen for simplicity. Of the history of lung cancer (with the affected relative aged under 60 at risk factors included in the LLP risk model, a prior diagnosis of diagnosis), a history of asbestos exposure and a prior diagnosis of malignant tumour is particularly interesting. First, it is important cancer. His estimated risk in the next 5 years is 3.16%. A man of to emphasise that lung cancer cases and controls diagnosed with a the same age without these three risk factors would have a 5-year malignant tumour (except melanoma) within 5 years of recruit- risk of 0.43%. The population or baseline risk in UK males of this ment were excluded from the study. In addition, there were no age (including those with and without risk factors) as calculated significant effect modifications between history of previous from National Statistics [(Office for National Statistics, 2005)](#_page36_x0.00_y217.00) is malignancy and other risk factors in terms of their effect on lung approximately 1.5%. The above and other examples are presented cancer risk. Having had a previous malignancy was associated with in [Table 3.](#_page34_x24.00_y43.00) a twofold increase in lung cancer risk. This is not unprecedented

[Figure 1](#_page34_x24.00_y252.00) shows the receiver operating characteristic curve ([Kabat, 1993](#_page36_x0.00_y127.00); [Mery et al, 2004).](#_page36_x0.00_y154.00) Previous studies have reported an derived when the model was applied to the case control increased risk of lung cancer among women receiving radio- population. The area under the curve is 0.71.

While this remains to be validated using Sensitivity and specificity of the LLP risk model compares independent data, the receiver operating characteristic curve gives favourably with previous lung cancer absolute risk models some insight as to the likely performance of the model using a developed by [Bach et al (2003)](#_page36_x0.00_y91.00) and [Spitz et al (2007).](#_page36_x0.00_y316.00) The Bach predefined cutoff.

smoked 10 60 cigarettes per day for 25 55 years. The Spitz model, like the LLP risk model, expands this concept by incorporating a panel of epidemiological risk factors to more accurately predict an individual s absolute risk of developing lung cancer. One limitation, however, is that cases and controls were frequency matched based on smoking status, perhaps affecting the importance of smoking as a risk factor. We believe that the LLP risk model s simplicity makes it more directly applicable for use in the primary care setting. Indeed, we are about to embark on a feasibility study in a large medical practice, which utilises the LLP risk model as the first stage in an early detection strategy, highlighting the potential importance and clinical relevance of our model.

An obvious strength of this study is that detailed information on the main risk factors such as active smoking, family history of lung cancer and occupational exposure was ascertained by closely supervised, trained interviewers using standardised question- naires. No proxy interviews were performed. All cases had histologically or cytologically confirmed primary lung tumours. In common with all risk prediction models, the LLP risk model has several limitations. First, the absolute risks estimated for each combination of risk factors are based on relative risks derived from a case control study. In this study, cases were individuals with newly diagnosed lung cancer identified by surveillance of all the hospitals responsible for the treatment of lung cancer in Liverpool and, after matching for age and sex, controls were selected from population lists that were essentially complete. Thus, cases and controls were both drawn from the same underlying population. However, the refusal rates were high, 42% among cases and 39% among controls. Given that these data did not permit description of smoking patterns of cases and controls refusing to participate, one cannot exclude that the lifestyle characteristics of nonparticipants may differ from the participants leading to an under- or overestimation of the true relative risks. There is also the potential that recall and other information biases could influence our results, as cases and controls were asked to report their lifestyle habits and behaviours for many years prior to interview. For these reasons, it is important that independent validation data be obtained to assess the relative risk features and absolute risk projections from this model. The limitations notwithstanding, this study can inform the debate about the best approach to select individuals at high risk of lung cancer for surveillance or prevention programmes.

Numerous nonrandomised studies have demonstrated that lung cancer can be diagnosed at a significantly earlier stage with CT screening than in current clinical practice (H[umphrey et al, 2004). ](#_page36_x0.00_y423.00)Strategies combining smoking history as defined by pack-years have, for the most part, been used as an approach to more efficiently conduct screening in high-risk smoking cohorts [(van Klaveren et al, 2002),](#_page36_x0.00_y360.00) thereby excluding individuals at significantly elevated risk of lung cancer not adequately reflected using these factors. For example, a 60-year-old male with long smoking history would be included while a similar aged never smoker would not. Using the LLP risk model, the 5-year estimated risk for a 60-year- old male with 42 years of smoking and a family history in an affected relative aged 60 years or over is 3.73% (95% CI, 1.85 7.38) while the risk for a 60-year-old male with no smoking history, a family history with an affected relative aged under 60 years, a prior diagnosis of cancer, a prior diagnosis of pneumonia and exposure to asbestos is 3.52% (95% CI, 1.90 6.45). Both these individuals have almost identical risk estimates (a one in 28 and one in 27 chance, respectively of lung cancer in the next 5 years) even though one has never smoked. The LLP risk model potentially provides a means to identify subgroups of both the smoking and nonsmoking populations that may benefit most from prevention

or surveillance.

Although some of the absolute risk estimates may seem rather high, they are consistent with population incidence. In the penultimate example in [Table 3,](#_page34_x24.00_y43.00) a 77-year-old male, never smoker but with an early-onset family history of lung cancer and occupational exposure to asbestos, has an estimated 5-year risk of 3.17%. The general population risk in England and Wales for males aged 75 79 is approximately 2.5%. The modelled risk is slightly higher due to the two risk factors. It is not four times higher as one might anticipate from the odds ratios for early-onset family history and exposure to asbestos, because the general population on average has some exposure to the risk factors in the model. The two most extreme examples in [Table 3 ](#_page34_x24.00_y43.00)have very high- predicted risks of around 30%, mainly but not entirely due to smoking. It should be noted that individuals with this level of risk are very rare; that is not more than 0.7% of cases and 0.3% of controls. This is reflected in the wide area of uncertainty in the confidence intervals, in both examples, showing a range of approximately 15 50% risk.

Although the results suggest that the LLP risk model may be useful for predicting risk, more work is needed to test the applicability of the model in diverse populations, including those from diverse geographic regions. It is clear that some populations, for example, African Americans, have risk factors other than those in our model ([Abidoye et al, 2007).](#_page36_x0.00_y74.00) Marked geographic differences in incidence rates necessitate separate evaluation of the LLP risk model in high- and low-risk areas. Moreover, developing separate models for men and women may allow for the inclusion of distinctive predictors and/or account for their variable distribution, thereby increasing predictive ability.

Although several issues concerning lung cancer risk prediction have been highlighted, we believe that its application as the first stage in an early detection strategy is a logical evolution in patient care. The results presented in this paper suggest that the LLP risk model could predict approximately two-thirds of lung cancer within 5-years, screening only 30% of the population. If resources were limited or the intervention carried such adverse effects as to require a very high-risk population to have a strong benefit harm balance, a subset of 10% of the population could be identified in which 34% of the cases would arise. The effect of restricting screening to a subpopulation of high-risk individuals will markedly reduce the cost of screening programmes at the expense of missing a proportion of lung cancers in individuals below the cutoff. This high-risk strategy  aims to help individuals with the greatest need of, and the potential to benefit from early detection. Such stratification on the basis of efficiency implies the difficult decision of where to place the cutoff, but the issue must be addressed nonetheless. It is likely that identifiable genetic susceptibility will, in the future, constitute an important factor in the selection of a more tightly defined risk group. In the meantime, it is appropriate to use a risk prediction model such as ours to identify a high-risk group for CT screening, so long as the results are not used to make inferences about a screening strategy in the general population ([Baker et al, 2004).](#_page36_x0.00_y118.00) If confirmed in validation studies, the LLP risk model could provide individuals and healthcare professionals with an easily obtained estimate of lung cancer risk to guide discussions and decisions regarding prevention

and surveillance.

population conditional on the matching variables, age and sex, one can estimate a using age- and sex-specific lung cancer incidence rates for the Liverpool area. [Table A1 ](#_page36_x290.00_y558.00)shows these rates per 100000person-years observed in 2002 2004. For example, to estimate the a corresponding to a five-year probability of developing lung cancer for males aged 50 54, one calculates the a for which the average value of p in equation (A2) over all male

controls aged 50 54 is equal to 5  0.0008865¼0.0044325. a is approximately equal to the inverse of the number of cases in Estimation by repeated bisection gives an a of 7.307. [Table A1](#_page36_x290.00_y558.00) the population age-sex stratum used to estimate the incidence, and also shows the derived a s and their standard errors, by age group corresponding to equation (A3)

and sex.

One further step is required to calculate an individual s a. For a ð5  y  0:5Þ2 VðaxÞ þ ðyþ 0:5Þ2 Vðaxþ5Þ

male aged 51 completed years, for example, we assume that his VðaxþyÞ ¼ 25

exact age is 51.5. He will therefore spend the next 3.5 years in the

age group 50 54 and the subsequent 1.5 years in the age group We use the variance estimate in (A4) to calculate the 95% 55 59. One can therefore calculate his individual a as confidence interval on LR and then transform the endpoints of the

confidence interval to the absolute probability scale as in Equation a ¼ 3:5   7:31þ 1:5   6:63 ¼ 7:106 (A2).

5 To compute the 95% confidence interval, we shall extend the More generally, for someone aged x þ y years, where x is a multiple example of a 51-year-old male with 25 years of smoking and no of 5 and y is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, the individual a is calculated as other risk factors. As demonstrated previously, he has a 0.3% risk

of developing lung cancer in the next 5 years. From [Table A1, ](#_page36_x290.00_y558.00)the axþy ¼ ð5  y  0:5Þ ax þ ðyþ 0:5Þ axþ5 ðA3Þ variance of the a (intercept) is

3:52 0:1712 þ 1:52 0:1322

Thus, for a 51-year-old male with 25 years of smoking and no other ¼ 0:016

risk factors, the 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer is estimated as 25

p ¼ 1þ expð ð 7:106þ 1:49ÞÞ¼ 0:00349 equation is 0.062. Thus, the 95% confidence interval on the logistic

In addition to providing an estimate of absolute risk, it is helpful 7:106þ 1:452  1:96 0:016þ 0:062
